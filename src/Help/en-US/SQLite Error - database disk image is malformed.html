Error â€“ database disk image is malformed</b></font></h1>
<p style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Segoe UI, sans-serif">When
finding <b>Documents by Text</b>, you encounter the <b>database disk
image is malformed</b> error. This error can occur when performing a
find sometime after one or more documents were deleted from the
SQLite database. If one or more documents were deleted sometime
before performing the find, then the fix in this topic should be
applied to rebuild the full-text search index and recreate the
synchronization triggers.</font></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal"><font face="Segoe UI, sans-serif">Before
applying the fix, please make sure that no transactions are running
against the database. Next, it is highly recommended to backup the
database file <b>PDFKeeper.sqlite</b>. By default, the database file
exists in <b>%APPDATA%\Robert F. Frasca\PDFKeeper</b> unless it was
moved to an alternate location.</font></p>
